# GovTech-Internship-Assessment

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook you will need:

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Required Libraries**: This project uses the following Python libraries:
   - `requests`: For fetching data from URLs.
   - `pandas`: For data manipulation and exporting to CSV files.
   
   If these libraries are not already installed, you can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install requests pandas
   ```

3. **Jupyter Notebook Environment**: The code is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file). You will need Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to run it. If you don't have it installed, you can install it via pip:
   ```
   pip install notebook
   ```
   and then launch Jupyter Notebook by running:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## File Path Changes

Before running the notebook, please update the following file paths according to your local environment:

1. **Excel File Path**:
   - **Original Path**: 
     ```
     C:\\Users\\Kevin\\OneDrive - Singapore Management University\\Desktop\\Internship Assessment\\Country-Code.xlsx
     ```
   - **Change Needed**: Update this path to the actual location of the `Country-Code.xlsx` file on your machine.

2. **CSV File Save Paths**:
   - The notebook saves output data to CSV files. You need to change these paths to where you want these CSV files to be stored.
   - **Example of Original Path**:
     ```
     C:\\Users\\Kevin\\OneDrive - Singapore Management University\\Desktop\\Internship Assessment\\[filename].csv
     ```
   - **Change Needed**: Replace these paths with the desired file locations on your system.
